I want you to create a user intutuive mobile application that can be installedd in IOS or android devices. The app should have a clean and modern design. The app should have a QR scanner feature that can scan QR codes and display the information in a user-friendly manner.    
Need
Signup screen with Name (As PEr Aadhar Card), Email, Mobile Number, Password, 
Login screen with Email and Password
Home screen
List of categories, list of QR codes genereated per category in horizontally scrollable list
Icon for user to create a item under any given category or custome category

Each item detail PAge should have 
category
Name
Description
QR Code (Will be auto generated and displayed once teh item is publihsed)
Status (Published or Draft)
Display Type (Each type is configured to show specific information after scanning QR code) like
ID => Name and phonenumber
Lost => Messgae, reply (should be able to send message to the user along with location)
and any other type seems suitable

Scan history

Right Top should have user profile icon. lcikced should slike minal details along with login.
Button click should display full page profile detailsProfile page should have anility to upload Aadhar photo. Verfifcation tem will verify async and give blue tick if verified.


Once teh Qr is generated, it should be stored in the database and can be accessed by the user. 
The QR code if scanned by any person, the system should log the scan timestamp and any details if user is logged in, if not then annonymous.


This si the basic idea, I want you to build it full and complete without any gaps, test throurghly that all features are working.
please also improvise if anything seems better.
Pelase ask any questions if any. before implemenmtation starts.
